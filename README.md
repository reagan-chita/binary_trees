# C - Binary Trees
This project involves a collaborative effort to explore the concept of binary trees in C programming. It covers various types of binary trees and their applications. The project's objectives include understanding the characteristics of trees, their advantages, and their drawbacks. This project also includes the implementation of binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.

## Contents
* tests: Directory containing test files for tasks, provided by Holberton School.
* binary_tree_print.c: C function for printing binary trees in a visually appealing format.
* binary_trees.h: Header file with definitions and prototypes for types and functions developed for the project.
## Data Structures
* binary_tree_t: Basic structure for binary trees.
* bst_t: Binary search tree structure.
* avl_t: AVL tree structure.
* heap_t: Max Binary Heap structure.
## Functionality
* The project implements various tasks, such as:

Creating, inserting, and deleting nodes in binary trees.
Traversal methods: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
Computing properties of trees: height, depth, size, leaves, nodes, balance, etc.
Validating binary search trees and AVL trees.
Inserting, searching, and removing nodes in binary search trees.
Converting arrays to binary search trees and AVL trees.
Analyzing time complexities of different operations.
